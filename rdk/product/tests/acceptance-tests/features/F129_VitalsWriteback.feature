  When the client requests all vitals for patient DFN: "228" from FileMan dates "3131028" to "3131030"
  Then a successful response is returned
  Then the JSON response "meta.ssn4" field is "0013"
  Then the JSON response "readings.data.items[0].readingDate.reading" field is "NO DATA"

  When the client saves an vital for "10113V428140" with the paramters
