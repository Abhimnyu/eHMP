Feature: F320 : TextSearchImprovements
#This feature will enhance the current text search engine used within eHMP to improve areas such as predications, synonyms, misspellings, duplicates, suggestions, as well as others.
#As an eHMP user, I need to be able to have a broad range of synonyms and acronyms returned when I enter queries into text search; so that I can have a more varied selection than what is currently available.
